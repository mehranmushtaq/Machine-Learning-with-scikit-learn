## 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
Regularized Regression Analysis using Lasso & Ridge Models
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow to predict medical insurance charges. It explores the power of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, utilizing Scikit-learn pipelines and automated hyperparameter tuning to find the most accurate prediction model.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal is to predict insurance charges based on demographic and health-related features while comparing the performance of regularized regression models to determine which handles the data's complexity more effectively.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The model is trained on beneficiary data including:
• Numerical Features: age, bmi, children
• Categorical Features: sex, smoker, region
• Target Variable: charges (The total medical cost billed by health insurance)

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Workflow
The project implements a structured, production-ready pipeline:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables through encoding.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating interaction terms (e.g., bmi_smoker) to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Data Splitting: 70/30 Train-Test split for robust evaluation.
4. Pipeline Integration: * Standardization: Using StandardScaler to normalize features.
• Modeling: Seamlessly connecting scaling to the regression estimator to prevent data leakage.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to find the optimal \bm{\alpha} (regularization strength).
6. Evaluation: Comparing models using {R^2}, MSE, and RMSE.
 
## 🏆 Model Results
## Lasso Regression (L1)
• Best Alpha: 100
• R² Score: 0.7690
• RMSE: 5,819.58
## Ridge Regression (L2)
• Best Alpha: 10
• R² Score: 0.7692
• RMSE: 5,816.97
Note: Ridge Regression performed slightly better, suggesting that shrinking coefficients (L2) was more effective than the feature elimination (L1) approach for this specific dataset.
